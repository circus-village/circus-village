## Information

The village has a herbal steam sauna next to a river beach, wood fire ovens and a spacious open Shala for group events.

The land is cultivated with an organic garden producing leafy greens and an orchard with saplings and mature fruit trees. Many species of bamboo have been planted to diversify the ecosystem and supply building materials for the environmentally friendly bungalows.

### Food

We offer delicious Asian and international food using organic produce from the garden or other local farms where possible. The type of food varies for each event please contact your event organizer for more information.

### Accommodation

Our beautiful traditional Laos houses and bungalows are on the river with private natural pools. Bungalows and huts have shared bathrooms and toilets. We provide bedding for everyone.

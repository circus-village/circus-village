Don Hanson

![don-hanson](assets/img/teachers/don-hanson.jpg) Don Hanson M.A. is an international teacher, healer and group process facilitator. He has spent over 40 years unraveling his own fear-based belief systems and mind-sets and has awakened a profound ability to bring through powerful healing energies.

These sacred healing energies combine with Don's psychic, intuitive skills and group process experience. The result is an unlocking on a cellular level of all inherited behavior patterns that keep you stuck in a limited level of consciousness and perspective.

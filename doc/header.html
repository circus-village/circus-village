The Circus Village is nested between two rivers with countless natural pools, private beaches, and the precious shade of a gigantic bamboo garden surrounded by a tropical teak forest and various hill tribe villages.

We offer delicious Asian and international food, and host everyone in traditional antique teak houses and bamboo bungalows along the riverside. With a herbal steam sauna and wooden fire ovens, a spacious open Shala, organic garden and more than an hectare of orchids, the circus village can host big groups on an enchanted private island and untouched paradise.

The village is  located 15 minutes walk from the the extraordinary Kuang Sii Waterfalls national park, 29 kilometres from Luang Prabang, the historical capital of Laos.
